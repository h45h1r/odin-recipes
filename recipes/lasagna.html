The dish is often baked until golden and bubbling, creating a mouthwatering combination of flavors and textures. Whether you're hosting a dinner party or simply craving a satisfying meal, lasagna is sure to please everyone at the table.</p>
        <p>In this lasagna recipe, tender lasagna noodles are layered with a savory meat sauce, creamy ricotta cheese, and gooey melted mozzarella. The meat sauce is made with a combination of ground beef, onions, garlic, and herbs, simmered in a rich tomato sauce. The ricotta cheese mixture is seasoned with herbs, Parmesan cheese, and eggs, adding a creamy and indulgent element to the dish. To assemble the lasagna, start by spreading a layer of the meat sauce at the bottom of a baking dish. Place a layer of cooked lasagna noodles on top, followed by dollops of the ricotta cheese mixture. Repeat these layers until all the ingredients are used, ensuring the top layer is meat sauce and shredded mozzarella. Bake the lasagna in the oven until the cheese is melted and bubbly, and the flavors have melded together. The result is a lasagna with perfectly cooked noodles, a robust meat sauce, and a melty cheese topping that creates a satisfying combination of flavors and textures. Serve this classic Italian dish with a side of garlic bread and a fresh green salad for a complete and comforting meal that will have everyone coming back for seconds.</p>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all your ingredients</li>
            <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</li>
            <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
